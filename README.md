# spirit-animal
Website to determine best spirit animal match for users

Users enter their name and answer a series of questions. The site then scores these against an existing set of animals' attributes and returns the closest match, along with the percentage score.

A user's name and best match animal are saved locally and that info is re-surfaced if they refresh or revisit the site.

Site uses HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript for all functionality.
